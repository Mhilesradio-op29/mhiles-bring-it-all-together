            <h2>Why I Am Selling My Army</h2>
            <p>
                Selling this collection is not easy. Over the past few years, I have spent countless hours building, painting, and playing with my <strong>Warhammer 40,000</strong> miniatures. It has been one of my favorite hobbies — a great way to relax, be creative, and connect with friends. Unfortunately, tuition bills do not pay themselves, and I have reached a point where I need to make a difficult decision. <em>This collection means a lot to me</em>, but my education must come first.
            </p>

            <p>
                Every figure has been painted by hand with great care and attention to detail. From the shading on the armor to the realistic bases, I have tried to make each model stand out on the battlefield. If you have ever played Warhammer, you understand how much work and passion go into each piece. <strong>This is not just plastic — it is hundreds of hours of effort, strategy, and pride.</strong> Whether you are building your own army or simply enjoy well-painted miniatures, this collection is worth a look.
            </p>

            <p>
                The collection includes over 80 figures, including Space Marines, HQ units, vehicles, and custom terrain pieces. Most are fully painted and ready to play. There are also a few rare and limited-edition models that would make excellent additions to any army. I am asking between <strong>$20 and $70</strong> per item, depending on the piece. If you are interested or have any questions, please feel free to reach out at <em>pennstatemark@gmail.com</em>. I would love for these models to go to someone who will enjoy them as much as I have.
